.SH NAME
_printf \- format and print data

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf() produces a formatted output to stdout.

The output of _printf() is formatted by a format string that specifies how
arguments are to be handled.

.SS Format of the format string
The format string of _printf() is a character string, composed of zero or more
directives - ordinary characters (all aside from '%') are copied unchanged to
the output stream, and conversion specifications fetch a subsequent argument.
A conversion specification is introduced by the character '%' and ends with
a conversion specifier.

The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier.
The arguments are used in the order given, where each conversion specifier
asks for the next argument in the list.

.SS Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion
specifiers and their meanings are:

.IP d, i
The int argument is converted to decimal notation.

.IP c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting
character is written.

.IP s
The const char * argument is xpected to be a pointer to an array of
character type (that is, a pointer to a string). Characters from the array
are written up to, but not including, a terminating null byte ('\0').


.SH RETURN VALUE
If successful, _printf() returns the number of characters printed, excluding
the null byte character used to end output.

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned instead.
